# coffee-subscription

This is a solution to the [Coffeeroasters subscription site challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/coffeeroasters-subscription-site-5Fc26HVY6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

You simply get the figma files/assets and you have to build it yourself from scratch!

This is both a mobile and a desktop version of a simple coffee subscription website.

It features React, SCSS & HTML as well as routing to multiple sections of the website.

A live version can be found here https://coffee-subscription.herokuapp.com/
